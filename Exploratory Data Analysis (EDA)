a) .describe(), .info(), .value_counts()
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Pragna Sree/Desktop/train.csv")

print("Non-null counts:")
print(data.count())

print("Survived count:")
print(data['Survived'].value_counts())

print("Sex count:")
print(data['Sex'].value_counts())

print("Pclass count:")
print(data['Pclass'].value_counts())

print("Embarked count:")
print(data['Embarked'].value_counts())

output:
Non-null counts:
PassengerId    891
Survived       891
Pclass         891

dtype: int64
Survived count:

1    342
Name: Survived, dtype: int64
Sex count:
male      577
female    314
Name: Sex, dtype: int64
Pclass count:

Name: Pclass, dtype: int64
Embarked count:
S    644
C    168
Q     77
Name: Embarked, dtype: int64
Observation:
Survived: More passengers did not survive than survived.
Sex: Males are more than females.
Pclass: Most passengers belong to 3rd class.
Age: Missing values are present.
Fare: Highly varied → possible outliers.

b) Visualization using sns.pairplot() and sns.heatmap()
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Pragna Sree/Desktop/train.csv")
sns.pairplot(data, hue="Survived")
plt.show()
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.show()

output:
graph in output task 5 file

c) Identify Relationships & Trends
Females survived more than males.
Higher class passengers (Pclass=1) had better survival chances.
Children and younger passengers survived more.
Higher fare → higher survival probability.

d) Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Pragna Sree/Desktop/train.csv")
sns.histplot(data['Age'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title("Age Distribution")
plt.show()

output:
graph in output task 5 file


e) Observations for Each Visual (Summary)
Visual	Key Insight
Pairplot	Survival strongly depends on Sex, Fare, Pclass
Heatmap	Fare & Pclass correlated with survival
Histogram	Majority passengers aged 20–40
Boxplot	Higher fare increases survival chance
Scatterplot	Young & rich passengers survived more

f) Final Summary of Findings
Gender is the strongest survival factor.
Passenger class significantly impacts survival.
Higher fare correlates with higher survival.
Children and younger passengers had better chances.
Missing values in Age need handling before modeling.
