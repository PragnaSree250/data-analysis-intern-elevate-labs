# Netflix Titles Data Cleaning (Pandas)
## Files
- `code for cleaning the data using pandas` – Python script that performs all data‑cleaning steps.
- `netflix_titles.csv` – cleaned Netflix titles dataset generated by the script.   
- `output.spydata` – Spyder workspace session containing variables after running the code.
- `Screenshot 2025-12-08 214242.png` – screenshot showing the DataFrame output after cleaning.

## Data‑Cleaning Steps
- Loads the raw Netflix dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Identifies missing values with `.isnull().sum()` and fills key columns (`country`, `date_added`, `director`, `cast`) with suitable defaults.
- Removes duplicate rows using `.drop_duplicates()`.
- Standardizes text (trims spaces, normalizes casing) for columns such as `country` and `type`.
- Converts `date_added` to `datetime`, adds a `dd-mm-yyyy` formatted column, and enforces proper data types like integer for `release_year`.
- Exports the cleaned DataFrame to `netflix_titles.csv` in the working directory.

#TASK 3
**Zepto Sales Data Analysis**
This project analyzes Zepto sales data using MySQL. The dataset includes product details, category, city-wise sales, pricing, discounts, orders, and revenue. Analysis covers creating databases, tables, views, and performing queries with filtering, aggregation, sorting, and joins. Indexes are added for query optimization.
**Dataset**
File: zepto_sales_dataset.csv
Columns: Product Name, Category, City, Original Price, Current Price, Discount, Orders, Total Revenue, Influencer Active
**Steps**
Create Database & Table
MySQL database amazon_sales and table zepto_sales.
Load Data
Imported CSV data into zepto_sales.
Create Views
category_performance to summarize revenue and orders by category.
Perform Queries
Aggregate analysis (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Filtering (WHERE)
Sorting (ORDER BY)
Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
Subqueries for complex metrics
Optimizations
Indexes added on category, city, and other frequently queried columns.
**Notes**
Deleting the database removes all tables and views.
Views must be recreated if the database is recreated.
Enables quick analysis of sales trends, revenue, and influencer campaign impact.
