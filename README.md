# Netflix Titles Data Cleaning (Pandas)
## Files
- `code for cleaning the data using pandas` – Python script that performs all data‑cleaning steps.
- `netflix_titles.csv` – cleaned Netflix titles dataset generated by the script.   
- `output.spydata` – Spyder workspace session containing variables after running the code.
- `Screenshot 2025-12-08 214242.png` – screenshot showing the DataFrame output after cleaning.

## Data‑Cleaning Steps
- Loads the raw Netflix dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Identifies missing values with `.isnull().sum()` and fills key columns (`country`, `date_added`, `director`, `cast`) with suitable defaults.
- Removes duplicate rows using `.drop_duplicates()`.
- Standardizes text (trims spaces, normalizes casing) for columns such as `country` and `type`.
- Converts `date_added` to `datetime`, adds a `dd-mm-yyyy` formatted column, and enforces proper data types like integer for `release_year`.
- Exports the cleaned DataFrame to `netflix_titles.csv` in the working directory.

#TASK 3
**Zepto Sales Data Analysis**
This project analyzes Zepto sales data using MySQL. The dataset includes product details, category, city-wise sales, pricing, discounts, orders, and revenue. Analysis covers creating databases, tables, views, and performing queries with filtering, aggregation, sorting, and joins. Indexes are added for query optimization.
**Dataset**
File: zepto_sales_dataset.csv
**Steps**
Create Database & Table
MySQL database amazon_sales and table zepto_sales.
Load Data
Imported CSV data into zepto_sales.
Perform Queries
Aggregate analysis (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Filtering (WHERE)
Sorting (ORDER BY)
Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
Indexes added on category, city, and other frequently queried columns.

#Task 5
Titanic EDA
Overview
This project performs a brief Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger details and survival patterns.

Dataset
File: train.csv
Tools Used
Python,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Spyder IDE

Analysis Performed
Checked non-null and missing values
Generated summary statistics
Analyzed value counts for key features
Visualized data using histograms, boxplots, pairplot, and heatmap

Key Findings
Females had a higher survival rate than males
First-class passengers survived more
Higher fare is associated with better survival chances
Missing values exist in Age and Cabin columns
